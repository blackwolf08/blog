Skill is something one acquires by perseverance, hard work and a lot of practise. It is then when someone becomes Skilled. On the other hand, talent, is something one is born with. It is their natural aptitude. It is true that people with talent are better at doing things, as compared to other people, but it should also be known that their expertise due to talent can be surpassed with constant practise and hard work.",Object(s.b)("p",null,"How am I able to code well?
